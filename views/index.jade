  h2 Interests

  p I am an avid traveler; in 2013, I traveled with People to People Student Ambassador Programs to the British Isles, and I have visited many locations in the U.S. and abroad with my family. That said, I have lived in the greater Philadelphia area for my whole life, and Philly truly is my home.

  p My greatest love in life is dogs. My parents and I regularly care for our friends’, neighbors’, and family members’ dogs while they are away. In 2014 and 2015, I fostered a black lab from the PSPCA for five months. Bear was a senior dog who needed medical care before he could be placed for permanent adoption. I am proud to say that when he returned to the PSPCA, Bear was a healthy dog, ready to find a forever home.
